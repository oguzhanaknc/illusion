# Roadmap

Milestones are delivered in order; each one ends with tests, benchmarks, bilingual documentation and
ADRs for its significant decisions. Items marked ✅ are done.

## M0 — Foundation ✅

- ✅ Repository, CMake presets, pinned dependencies (FetchContent + SHA-256)
- ✅ CI: Windows (MSVC, clang-cl), Linux (GCC, Clang, ASan/UBSan, TSan), macOS; format, docs, Doxygen
- ✅ Core: platform macros, assertions, logging with sinks, thread utilities, hashing, type names
- ✅ Memory: aligned allocation, `LinearAllocator`, `PoolAllocator`, `InplaceFunction`
- ✅ Job System: lock-free bounded queue, counters with helping waits, `parallelFor`
- ✅ ECS: archetypes with 16 KiB SoA chunks, tags, cached queries, chunk and parallel iteration,
  `CommandBuffer`
- ✅ Tracy integration, benchmark harness with budgets
- ✅ Documentation site (EN/TR, parity check), ADRs 0001–0006, AGENTS.md and skills

## M1 — Platform and first pixels ✅

- ✅ Window and keyboard/mouse input (GLFW), headless backend for tests
- ✅ High-resolution timer, frame clock, fixed timestep
- ✅ File system abstraction (virtual paths, atomic writes, platform user-data directories)
- ✅ Event bus (immediate and queued delivery)
- ✅ NVRHI device creation on Vulkan 1.3 with a run-time loader; swapchain with resize and vsync control
- ✅ Slang shader pipeline (build-time SPIR-V, embedded); diagnostic triangle and `hello_triangle` sample
- ✅ Vulkan + NVRHI validation in Debug; GPU tests on Mesa lavapipe in CI (offscreen and swapchain under Xvfb)
- macOS: bundle and verify MoltenVK (no GPU CI runner yet; tracked for M8 packaging)

## M2 — Input ✅

- ✅ SDL3 gamepad subsystem: Xbox and DualSense, hot-plug, player slots, rumble, trigger rumble, LED, gyro,
  touchpad, adaptive triggers; virtual gamepads for tests and automation
- ✅ Action-mapping layer (button/axis/vector actions), rebinding capture, text persistence, per-device glyphs
- `input_viewer` sample for manual verification with real controllers

## M3 — Renderer core ✅

- M3a: ✅ glTF 2.0 import (meshes, materials, textures), forward PBR, reversed-Z, parallel frustum culling,
  instancing, `gltf_viewer` sample (ADR 0013)
- M3b: ✅ IBL from HDRIs (Poly Haven): GPU-baked background and prefiltered specular cube maps, SH
  irradiance, multiple-scattering split sum, `SkyLight`, procedural sky (ADR 0014)
- M3c: ✅ CSM + PCSS soft shadows: up to 4 stable, texel-snapped cascades, per-pass culling masks,
  alpha-masked casters, blocker search sized by the light's angular diameter (ADR 0015)
- M3d: ✅ HDR pipeline with depth prepass, GTAO, energy-preserving bloom, ACES tonemapping, optional TAA
  (camera reprojection, variance clipping) (ADR 0016)
- M3e: ✅ Two-phase GPU occlusion culling with indirect draws, per-object motion vectors for TAA, GPU
  frame-time benchmarks (ADR 0017)
- M3f: ✅ Bindless materials and textures, shared geometry pools, multi-draw indirect where supported
  (ADR 0018)

## M4 — Assets and streaming ✅

- M4a: ✅ Binary serialization, stable asset ids, cooked image and model formats, import cache validated by
  source content hashes (xxHash64) (ADR 0019)
- M4b: ✅ Async streaming (dedicated I/O thread, Job System), shared asset handles published in update(),
  GPU upload queue with a byte budget (ADR 0020)
- M4c: ✅ Packed archives (`.illpak`, memory-mapped, hash-checked), VFS archive mounts, `illusion_pack` with
  asset cooking, shipping without sources (ADR 0021)

## M5 — Gameplay services

- M5a: ✅ Component reflection with stable, explicit names; JSON scene files (yyjson); type-erased World
  access; semantic versions (ADR 0022)
- M5b: ✅ Jolt Physics on the Job System: RigidBody/Collider Components, fixed step with interpolation,
  forces and impulses, raycasts, contact events, collision layers, `physics_playground` sample (ADR 0023)
- M5d: Physics extensions: mesh and convex-hull colliders, character controller, joints, shape casts
- M5c: miniaudio integration (3D sound, mixer)

## M6 — Game modules and hot reload

- Module/plugin system with semver; game module as hot-reloadable shared library in the editor and
  statically linked in exports
- Service injection into modules (ADR 0003): Logger, ComponentRegistry, assert handler; re-registration
  of module-owned component types on reload

## M7 — Editor and AI control

- Editor UI, scene editing, gizmos
- Asset references in scenes, so that `MeshRenderer` and `SkyLight` are saved (ADR 0022)
- Command/tool API (JSON-RPC and MCP) covering every editor operation
- Acceptance test: an agent builds a Tetris-like game end to end without human input
- Test scene exercising every component and the whole scripting API

## M8 — Release pipeline

- Export: clean runtime build, packed assets, no editor code
- CPack installers: Windows (signing-ready), macOS `.app` (notarization-ready), Linux (Steam Runtime
  "sniper" compatible)
- Optional Steamworks module (achievements, cloud saves, Steam Input); SDK supplied by the user
- Release and Steam guide (EN/TR)
